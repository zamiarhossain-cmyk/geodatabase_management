This repository contains a set of Python (ArcPy) scripts designed to audit, validate, and quality-check Mouza-level GIS data across different production stages:

Digitized (D / LD, MD, SD, PD, ND)

RawGeo (RG / LRG, MRG, SRG, PRG, NRG)

Geo (G / LG, MG, SG, PG, NG)

Edgematch / Merged layers (MG)


Missing sheets
Missing layer types
Duplicate layers
Stage-to-stage workflow violations
Feature loss or duplication after edgematch/merge
If any of these scripts fail, the data is objectively broken.
